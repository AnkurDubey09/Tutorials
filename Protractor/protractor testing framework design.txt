Setting up framework using Protractor testing framework:

We have following directories under the root directory:

1- i18n - having multiple locale's JSON file, which has data in key:value format.
2- logs - log files for end to end execution.
3- reports - html report.
4- po - page objects, segregated under respective sub-directories.
5- specs - testing scenarios, segregated under respective sub-directories.
6- utils - utilities for commonly used, they could be project specific or external commonly used.

Apart from these directories, we have following file or configurations under the root directory.

1- mail.js - having mail utility for sending email notification.
2- log.js - creating log files.
3- listener-reporter.js or event.js - event listener actions.
4- package.json - all the dependencies.
5- protractor.conf.js - testing configurations.

There could be some other files or directories also as per the requirement.

We have to run 'npm install' command on command prompt so that all the listed dependencies under package.json are downloaded 
under the node_modules folder in root directory.
